NADA-R        version 1.0 Feb, 2005.NADA data in R/S language for use in R or S-Plus.  Data files for exercises from the textbookNondetects And Data Analysis:  Statistics for censored environmental databy Dennis R. Helsel 2005 copyright Wiley, New York These data are taken from the freely-available NADA for R package by Lopaka Lee<rclee@usgs.gov>.  NADA for R is available at CRAN mirrors worldwide(http://www.r-project.org).There are some minor variable name changes that have been made -- somedatasets and/or variables do not have the exact names as listed in the NADAbook.  This was a result of S-language constrants.Also note that all censoring indicators have been set to equal 1 for censorined observations.  This differs from the data as shown in the textbook, but is consistent with S-language constraints.
